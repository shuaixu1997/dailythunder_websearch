# dailythunder_websearch
A tiny web search engine based on web scraping 
input the keyword on the web search bar, return the newest related content inside the site "dailythunder.com"

[P.S. it takes few more seconds if the keyword is rare or user wants to display more. 
      Generally it is a bit slow because of the web scraping every time.
      To improve the efficiency, just simply create a database to store the articles and comments from dailythunder regularly.]
