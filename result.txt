The oft-injured shooting guard has lottery talent, but a Division III foot. In his first two seasons at Michigan, LeVert averaged 35 games per season. In his final two seasons, LeVert played in only 31 games total. He had 3 surgeries in a 22 month period on his foot, in which he later admitted was due to a Jones fracture, much like Kevin Durant. If the Thunder medical team gives the okay on LeVert, I could see the front office taking a chance on him, especially if he slips into the 2nd round.

Bringing banner No. 18 to Boston would cement his legacy as a player and make him a legend in these parts. If the Celtics were smart, they'd get other area sports stars like Tom Brady and David Ortiz to relay what it's like to have this city in the palm of your hand. If nothing else, he's got all those free crab legs promised by Legal Sea Foods"
